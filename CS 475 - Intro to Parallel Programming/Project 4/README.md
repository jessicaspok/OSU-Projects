Project #4

Functional Decomposition

Use parallelism, not for speeding data computation, but for programming convenience. 
Create a month-by-month simulation in which each agent of the simulation will execute in its own thread where it just has to look at the state of the world around it and react to it.

1. The amount the grain grows is affected by the temperature, amount of precipitation, and the number of "graindeer" around to eat it. The number of graindeer depends on the amount of grain available to eat.
2. The temperature and precipitation are a function of the particular month.
3. Add in some other phenomenon that directly or indirectly controls the growth of the grain and/or the graindeer population.
4. Record the data
