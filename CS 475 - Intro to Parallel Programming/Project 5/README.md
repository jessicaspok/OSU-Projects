Project #5

Vectorized Array Multiplication and Reduction using SSE

Test array multiplication, SIMD and non-SIMD. 
Test array multiplication and reduction, SIMD and non-SIMD.

1. Run an array multiplication timing experiment (SIMD SSE and non-SIMD)
2. Run an array multiplication + reduction timing experiment (SIMD SSE and non-SIMD)
3. Use different array sizes
4. Record the data
5. Calculate and compare speedup for SSE/non-SSE

Compile and execute in Linux by typing:
python3 runProj5.py
