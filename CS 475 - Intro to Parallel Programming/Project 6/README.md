Project #6

OpenCL Array Multiply, Multiply-Add, and Multiply-Reduce

1. Multiply two arrays together using OpenCL, benchmark it against both input array size and the local work size 
2. Multiply two arrays together and add a third using OpenCL, benchmark it against both input array size and the local work size 
3. Perform the same array multiply as in #1, but this time with a reduction, benchmark it against input array size
4. Record the data
