							"You step into the Thirsty Whistle, the aura of death still lingering about. The establishment has all the expected \ntrappings of a small town bar, with dated decor, a lack of windows, and a faux taxidermized creature one could at least \ngather was part eagle and part snake. The place was barren, death has that affect. Along the walls are booths, with \nsome round tables and accompanying chairs around the center. To your left, a stage that is clearly the focal point of \nkaraoke Wednesdays. To the right is the actual bar. Behind it you see what must be the bartender. In the back you see a \ncorner booth sectioned off with police tape. To the East is the Morgue.\n",          						// "Bar",                       
							
							"You find yourself inside of a small, very dimly lit hidden room behind the closet wall. There is some small shelving \nfilled with boxes against the larger part of the wall. On the back wall facing south looks to be a peephole, with \nanother across from it on the wall facing the interior of the bar. You aren't sure why a small town bar has a hidden room, \nbut it can't be for anything but shady purposes. On the ground is a pile of rags next to a box. Maybe you could see more\nif you had more light. Behind you to the south is the way you came in.\n",       		// "Hidden Room",               
							
							"You walk into a very large, open room. Strewn about are various desks, half filled with busy looking policeman. Across \nthe walls are various reports and in one corner an open break room, without the walls, with a table. Next to the break \narea is a bulletin board with papers and notes pinned to it. On the other end is a room with opaque glass and the \ntitle and name 'Captain O'Hare' painted across it. You can barely make out shadows through the glass, but it seems \nsomeone is in there. To the West is Main Street, the Pharmacy to the North, and Beth's House to the South.\n",      
																	// "Police Station",            
																	
							"You enter the small town Morgue. At first glance it seems like it rarely gets used: everything looks pristine and \nthere lacks any odor, not even a chemical one. Surprising, given Bobby's body lay across the stainless steel table in \nthe middle of the room. While the room may seem small and dated, it appears to have state of the art equipment. Sitting \nat a desk is the ME. To the west is Main Street, and to the South is The Pharmacy.\n",       
																		// "Morgue",                    
																		
							"You step into Rory Johnson's Pharmacy, which as you can tell is actually more of the town grocery store. The place is \nbrightly lit, which is somewhat straining on the eyes since the floors and walls are all done in white. There are a few \nisles with assorted foodstuffs for sale on shelves, with a wall of coolers and freezers and a little section for \nproduce. In the back you see the window for the Pharmacy aspect of the store, which standing on the business side is a \nman in a white long physician's coat. This must be the Johnson as advertised in the store's name, the Pharmacist. To \nthe west is Main Street, the Morgue to the North, and the Police Station to the South.\n",     
																		// "Pharmacy",      
																		
							"You stand in Bobby's living room. There is a leather couch and a couple of leather loungers that sit around a large \ntelevision set. There are posters on the wall of various cult classic movies and a framed guitar signed by a band \nyou've never heard of before. To the West is his bedroom, the South an office, and to the East is the front porch you \ncame in from.\n",        
																		// "Bobby Living Room",         
																		
							"The office has a small desk with a leather office chair beside it. Under it is a large computer tower, with three \nmonitors on the top of the desk. On the walls are pictures of him posing with large groups of friends. Above his desk \na framed jersey with his own last name on it. To the North is Bobby's living room.\n",

							"You stand in Bobby's Bedroom. The bedspread and pillow cases are themed after a widely popular football team. There \nis a nightstand next to the bed and next to that a talk bookshelf containing many trophies, most of them in sports. \nYou notice a few of them at the bottom are for a grade 3 tap dancing competition. To the East is the living room.\n",        
																		// "Bobby Bedroom",             
																		
							"You stand before Bobby's house, brown and lackluster. The porch has been enclosed with screen walls that are tattered \nand no longer serve a purpose. You see various sports paraphernalia scattered about the lawn. Of note is the old muscle \ncar in the driveway. In contrast with the rest of the surroundings is its immaculate condition. Nearby in the carport \nare some large shiny red tool chests and oiled rags. Clearly the focus of Bobby's off time was the upkeep of this \nclassic. It's Montero Red. To the East is Claire's House, to the North is Sam's front Porch.\n",        
																		// "Bobby Front Porch",         
																		
							"You are standing in Claire's living room. The furniture is old, perhaps a mixture of the 70's and 80's with a few \ncontemporary replacements such as the television and other electronics. To the east is a door to Claire's bedroom, \nand behind you to the west is the front door that leads out to Claire's porch. The outdoor theme of painted sunflowers \nhas seeped into the place, continuing across the walls and reflecting in various indoor type Knick knacks as well as \nthe large sunflower shaped throw run on the hardwood floor.\n",     
																		// "Claire Living Room",        
																		
							"You stand inside a small cold-war era home built bunker. Everything inside looks old and dated, with canned food \nstacked up against a wall next to jugs of water. In the center is a shrine that stands out against everything else. To \nthe north up the ladder is Claire's living room.\n",   
																		// "Claire Bunker", 
																		
							"You are in Claire's bedroom. Her bed is covered with a shaggy brown comforter with many sunflower shaped pillows all \nover it, resembling a garden perhaps. There is a large dresser against the wall with many family pictures on it. To the \nwest is Claire's living room.\n",     	// "Claire Bedroom",            
							
							"You stand before Claire's house. The house seems to have seen better days, having seemingly not aged as well as the \nother homes. This fact is somewhat covered up by the large amount of knickknacks strewn about, from garden gnomes to \nplastic flamingos and other statuesque things you aren't completely sure are meant to be art or a complete unintended \nabuse of the term. Large sunflowers are painted along the outside of the front of the house. Apparently, not everyone \ncan have good taste. To the west is Bobby's House.\n",     
																		// "Claire Front Porch",        
																		
							"You are standing in Beth's living room. The decor is quite modern, angular, and minimalistic. The open floor plan lets \nyou see the entirety of the kitchen as well, which holds to the theme of the rest of the house quite well. There is a \ntable with a box on it. Behind you, to the west is Beth's front porch, and to the east is her bedroom.\n",       
																		// "Beth Living Room",          
																		
							"You are in Beth's bedroom. You aren't surprised to see nothing but the color white. You speculate she may be color \nblind and therefore doesn't try. The bed is covered by a white down comforter and is neatly made, next to it a \ndresser with a barren top. To the west is Beth's living room porch.\n",      
																		// "Beth Bedroom",              
																		
							"You find yourself at the front of Beth's house. While mostly like the other single floorplan ranch-style houses that \nline Main St, Beth's house exemplifies the concept of a model home. The house is painted white, so clean and bright one \ncould easily believe it was painted yesterday. A white picket fence declares the property boundaries with a quaint \ngarden that runs along with it. The lawn is well-manicured with not a single dead patch. Just add a cute red dog house \nand this place is magazine feature ready. To the west is Main Street, the Police Station to the North, and Claire's \nHouse to the South.\n",       					// "Beth Front Porch",  
							
							"You are standing in Sam's living room. A couple of brown suede couches sit against two walls near each other, with a \nglass coffee table and a few empty beer bottles atop it. The walls have framed newspapers from important events \nthroughout American history, from the moon landing to the Watergate Scandal. An entertainment center houses a TV, and \non the right section of it shelving. You notice on one shelf are 5 copies of Catcher in the Rye. To the West is his \nbedroom, and to the East the front porch.\n",        
																		// "Sam Living Room",           
																		
							"You are in Sam's bedroom. The bed is unmade, with open snack bags strewn about and a pile of newspapers next to the bed.\nAgainst the wall is a dresser with Alien model figurines mixed with robot-like figurines. Next to his bed is a \nnightstand with some pill bottles. On the other side of the bed is a desk with a computer on it. To the East is his \nliving room.\n",    						// "Sam Bedroom",               
																	
							"You stand before Sam's house. The house, blue with white trim, seems well cared for. In the front is a lawnmower \nresting amid a half-mown lawn. You hear some wind chimes sound from the porch as birds play in a small birdbath \npartially visible around the side of the house. A large oak tree towers up from behind the house, and you bet your \nbottom dollar it has a tire-swing. An orange cat lay sprawled across the warm concrete porch, its desire to relax \nkeeping the curiosity for the nearby birds at bay.\n",        
																		// "Sam Front Porch",           
																		
							"You stand in Trent's living room. A chaise sectional takes up two walls and a corner, with a bunch of blankets draped \nacross one end. A bird cage stands at the side of it with a cockatiel perched within. A TV sits across the longer part \nof the sectional, currently airing some kind of cartoon program. The open kitchen seems somewhat a mess. A table nearby \nhas a few bowls on it and a box of cereal, with some papers on it. To the West is the bedroom, and to the East is the \nfront porch.\n",      					// "Trent Living Room",         
							
							"You are standing in Trent's bedroom. There are two full size beds on opposite sides of the room, separated by a long \nlarger dresser. Scattered across the walls are posters for heavy metal bands. Towards a corner, you see an electric \ndrum set and an acoustic guitar next to it. Across the top of the dresser are miscellaneous items. To the East is the \nliving room.\n",      				// "Trent Bedroom",             
							
							"You stand before Trent's house. A pale yellow and rather bland house, not much seems to be going on as one may ponder \nif anyone even lives here. A chicken wire fence surrounds the place, which seems a slightly odd choice until you notice \na small chicken appear from the side of the house. After a short stare-down with you, it continues about pecking at the \nground. To the North is the Bar, the South is Moose's House, and to the East is the Pharmacy.",      						// "Trent Front Porch",         
							
							"You stand in Moose's Living Room. There is a large old couch that sits against the back wall opposite 3 medium sized \nTV's, each playing different sport's channels with one channel being that of a horse race. Moose and Sam are sitting at \nthe table, which is covered with various papers of handwritten notes and scribblings. To the East is the front porch, \nand the west is his bedroom.\n",      
																		// "Moose Living Room",         
																		
							"You are in Moose's Bedroom. Taking up most of it is a large waterbed with large thick fur blankets piled around the \ntop of it. There is a small table next to it, and against another wall is a dresser with empty beer cans stacked up \ninto a pyramid shape. Scattered across the floor are articles of clothing, and it's safe to assume they are dirty. You \nnotice a strong, musky odor lingering about. To the East is the Living Room.\n",      
																		// "Moose Bedroom",             
																		
							"You stand at Moose's house. The lawn is untamed, the house is white yet dirty from what very well may be years of zero \nattention. Parked in the lawn is an old beat up truck on cinder blocks. In the driveway is a Harley Davidson \nmotorcycle, and looks relatively new. On the back of it a small flag depicting the Jolly Roger flutters about in the \nlight wind. A plaque next to the front door claims that trespassers will be shot.\nTo the North is Trent's House, the South is Sam's House, and the East is the Police Station."
