There's been a murder in Small Town, U.S.A., and the STPD needs your help. 
To figure out whodunit, collect clues and talk to residents around town.

Once you're ready, open a Terminal and go to the location of these files.
To build, type:

    $ make

and to run the game, type:

    $ ./game
    $ new

Find enough evidence and arrest the guilty party to win the game and put the 
residents' minds at ease. If you need any help along the way, use the 'help' or 
'hint' commands.

This town's safety is in your hands, detective! They're counting on you!
