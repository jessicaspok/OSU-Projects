	3d6 is rolling three 6-sided dice. 2d10 is rolling two 10-sided dice.

 *Glare- If a Medusa rolls a 12 in attack then the target has looked her in the eyes and is turned to stone. The
	Medusa wins!
 
 *Charm- Vampires can charm an opponent into not attacking. For a given attack there is a 50% chance that
	their opponent does not actually attack them.
 
 *Mob- The Blue Men are actually a swarm of small individuals. For every 4 points of damage (round
	down) they lose on defense die. For example, when they reach strength of 8 they only have 2d6 for
	defense.
 
 *Hogwarts- If Harry dies (i.e. strength >=0) he immediately recovers. His total strength becomes 20. If he
	were to die again then heâ€™s dead.
