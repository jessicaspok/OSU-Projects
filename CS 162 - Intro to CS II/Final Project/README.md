Escape the House:

You are a thief.. You have decided to break into the house of a rich man as he is said to possess many valuables. 
You break in through the chimney but you will need to find another way out.
Once you're inside, you see a pitbull. But if you keep quiet, it won't attack.
You make your way into the bedroom and see a safe in the corner. 
You don't know the code, but decide to try opening it anyway.
Big mistake!! 
The safe set off a silent alarm - all of the windows and doors have been sealed and the police will arrive in 60 seconds!
You need to find a way out... quick! 
And don't make too much noise.. or the dog will get you.
