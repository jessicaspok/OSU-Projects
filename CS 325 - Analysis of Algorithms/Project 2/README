Welcome to the Group 26 change-making program code submission.

The included makefile will create two programs that we used to different sections of the project.

To verify our algorithm's correctness using an input file with structure indicated in the assignment,
run "make changefromfile" and run the resulting executable with the name of a source file. The
output will be placed in a file named "SOURCEchange.txt", where SOURCE is the name of the source file.

To test algorithm running time for selected values of A and set of coins V, run "make algotiming"
 and run the resulting executable. Input desired parameters and view results at STDOUT.
 
To create both programs, simply run "make" within this folder and then run the executable of your
choice as described above.
